The Code Alert Alexa Skill is an Alexa skill that provides information about upcoming coding contests. It fetches contest data from an API and presents the contests happening within the next week.

Check out [Code Alert](https://github.com/VishnuVardhanBR/CodeAlert) for a intuitive Discord Bot which utilizes slash commands to do the same.
